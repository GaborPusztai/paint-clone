# paint-clone
ZTM - Course project </br>
The Paint Clone Project is a web application that allows users to draw or paint on a canvas using their mouse or touch input. Typically, this project utilizes the HTML5 <canvas> element combined with JavaScript to capture user interactions (e.g., drawing, changing colors, adjusting brush size) and render the drawings in real-time.

Key Features:
Drawing: Users can draw freehand on the canvas.
Brush Size/Color: Option to adjust brush size and color.
Clear Canvas: A button to clear the drawing area.
Save: Option to save the drawing as an image (e.g., PNG).
Technologies Used:
HTML5 <canvas>
JavaScript (for handling events and drawing logic)
CSS (for styling the UI)
This project helps in understanding event handling, canvas manipulation, and basic graphics programming in JavaScript.
